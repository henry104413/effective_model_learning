Implements quantum system models made up of two-level subsystems (TLSs) representing qubits and defects. Allows single-site Lindblad processes and coherent couplings between any pairs of TLSs. Includes methods to generate dynamics with respect to specified observables.

Performs model learning given target data (times, observables, and measurements with respect to those). The algorithm is based on a reversible-jump Monte Carlo Markov chain. Based on user-specified hyperparameters, random moves are carried out and accepted or rejected. These include adding or removing Lindblad processes or couplings from a predefined library as well as tweaking existing parameters.
