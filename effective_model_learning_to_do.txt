to do:

later:


- when coupling a new TLS to an existing one, add the coupling information onto the other one's dictionary as well
...so that each TLS individually knows what it's coupled to
- this should probably be a TLS method that links back to the model and the passed reference to the other TLS
- then need a way to ensure coupling is not applied twice - for example by going through TLSs in order
...and only applying coupling if index is lower OR higher on second system


- input checks (too long for now)


- add learning


- add methods to only remove specific operators or subtract bits of Hamiltonian (as opposed to rebuilding everything)


- hermitianity - way to bind operators when learning to only change their coupling together...
...for now just use sigma x


- possibly move from tuples to custom numpy arrays to do dynamics allocation (mutable)
- also maybe have a form for storing coupling with a rate and then a bunch of ALL operators that go with it (hermitian conjugates etc)
